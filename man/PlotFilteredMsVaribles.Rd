\title{Visualize MS Metadata Filtering Results with Thresholds}
\usage{
PlotFilteredMsVaribles(msdata, ms_level, filter_threshold_value)
}
\arguments{
\item{msdata}{A \code{Spectra} object or a data frame-like object containing MS metadata.}

\item{ms_level}{Integer. The MS level (e.g., 1 or 2) to visualize.}

\item{filter_threshold_value}{A named list where each name corresponds to a
metadata column (e.g., \code{peaksCount}) and each value is a numeric vector
of length 2 representing the (minimum, maximum) threshold.}
}
\value{
A named \code{list} of \code{patchwork} objects. Each element is named
as \code{MS[level]_[variable]} and consists of the raw and sorted plots stacked vertically.
}
\description{
This function generates diagnostic plots that highlight the effect of filtering
on MS metadata variables. It uses color coding to distinguish between scans
that fall within the specified threshold range ("keep") and those that do not ("filtered").
}
\details{
For each variable in \code{filter_threshold_value}, the function creates:
\itemize{
\item \bold{Raw Plot}: Displays values by acquisition index, colored by filter status.
This helps identify if filtered scans are clustered at specific time points.
\item \bold{Sorted Plot}: Displays values in ascending order, colored by filter status.
This reveals where the "cuts" are made in the overall data distribution.
}
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Example thresholds: keep scans with 10 to 500 peaks
thresholds <- list(peaksCount = c(10, 500))

# Generate plots
filter_plots <- PlotFilteredMsVaribles(
  msdata = my_spectra,
  ms_level = 1,
  filter_threshold_value = thresholds
)

# Display the plot
print(filter_plots$MS1_peaksCount)
}
}
